Local Analytics is a plugin for integrating Google Analytics (http://www.google.com/analytics/) in your Wordpress powered blog. The plugin can download and serve urchin.js to your server and automatically update it at regular intervals.

== Description ==

Local Analytics is a Wordpress plugin for integrating Google Analytics, the free web analysis service by Google, into your blog. 
The plugin is highly configurable and also allows caching of the urchin.js file locally, inorder to enable faster loading of pages.

The plugin is highly configurable, yet simple. A normal user only needs to specify his / her Analytics UID, while advanced users can completely configure the plugin.

**Features**

* Highly configurable
* Includes support for local caching of urchin.js
* Includes support for tracking email links, external links and file downloads
* Includes support for tracking subdomains and main domain in a single profile
* Includes support for tracking visits to Admin Panels
* Includes support for tracking logged in users

== Installation ==

1. Download, unzip & upload the plugin to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to *Options / Local Analytics* and enter your Google Analytics UID and hit the *Save Options* button

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I enable caching =

* Your webpage loads faster, since your user’s browser can use the existing connection with your web server to download the file and doesn’t need to create a new connection to google’s server.
* Sometimes, though very rarely, google servers become overloaded and your page load time will be affected drastically.
* Some ad blockers are now blocking Google Analytics too. This script will be a work around to that too.
